MetroDeck
================
__MetroDeck is no longer under active development, see [this post](http://corbindavenport.com/?p=400) for more details.__

MetroDeck is an extension for Google Chrome and Opera that alters the appearance of TweetDeck to match Microsoft's Metro UI (also known as Modern/Universal UI). It works with both TweetDeck's light and dark themes.

I've designed MetroDeck in a way that shouldn't break with future TweetDeck updates, but should that happen, simply disable the MetroDeck extension until a patch is released. MetroDeck is licensed under the GPL v3 license.
